# Temporary-GPT

![DEMO](demo.gif)

A small tool to make life on ChatGPT more easier. Most of us only use ChatGPT for small quick questions. These are chats we'll never look back to and hence it would be best if ChatGPT never stored them in the first place.

This is why, using the TemporaryGPT userscript, you will be automatically redirected to the temporary chat of ChatGPT.  Just a little add-on but it will also close the sidebar so you that you can focus on your chat.

A great thing about this is that it will only work on the intial load, meaning it won't block you from going to a new chat or other parts of the website.
